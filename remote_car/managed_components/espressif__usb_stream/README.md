### Q&A

Q1. I encountered the following problems when using the package manager

```
Executing action: create-project-from-example
CMakeLists.txt not found in project directory /home/username
```

A1. This is because an older version package manager was used, please run `pip install -U idf-component-manager` in ESP-IDF environment to update.
